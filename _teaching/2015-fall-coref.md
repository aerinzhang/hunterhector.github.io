I gave a lecture on the topic on Coreference Resolution. Starting from reviewing the history of modern coreference resolution, I introduce the techniques, approaches and evaluation methods for entity coreference. I then talk about some new topics on a more general form of coreference, including quasi-coreference and event coreference.
