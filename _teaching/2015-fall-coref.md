I gave a guest lecture for the class "Tools for NLP" on the topic on Coreference Resolution. Starting from reviewing the history of modern coreference resolution, I introduce the techniques, approaches and evaluation methods for entity coreference. I then talk about some new topics on a more general form of coreference, including quasi-coreference and event coreference. I also discussed some relevant topics with the students, such as scripts and clustering.
